//Variables and Data Types
//JavaScript has three ways to declare variables:
//var (old, avoid using)
//let (block-scoped, recommended)
//const (cannot be reassigned)
let name = "Alice";//string
const age=25;//number
let isStudent=true;//boolean
let skills = ["JS","Python","C++"];//array
let person={name: "John", age:30};//object

console.log(name,age,isStudent,skills,person);
